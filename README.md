🚀 Overview

MINDSPACEXR is an adaptive AR/VR exposure-therapy platform designed to help users gradually overcome common phobias through controlled virtual environments. The system dynamically adjusts difficulty in real time based on user behavior and interaction cues, ensuring a safe and progressive experience.

🎯 Problem Statement

Many people struggle with phobias such as fear of public speaking, claustrophobia, and fear of darkness. Traditional therapy is not always easily accessible, and exposure therapy can feel intimidating.
MINDSPACEXR provides a safe simulation-based solution for gradual exposure and confidence-building.
